Hello and welcome to our fantastic game! An innocent princess has been kidnapped
by an evil dragon. She needs someone to save her. She needs YOU to save her.
Go get her tiger ;)
You move by using 

	w - up, 
	s - down, 
	a - left, 
	d - right, 

You can save by typing 'save' and check the contents of your backpack by typing
'checkbp'. There are also some secret commands, they are 'getName' and 'getType', 
but HUSH don't tell anybody! If you want to exit type 'exit', but why would you
want to do that? The rest should be self explanatory. Enjoy!
